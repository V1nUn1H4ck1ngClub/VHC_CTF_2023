## 1. Description:
So, my buddy, bullNull (yes, that's his real name, don't ask), is on this academic adventure at UIUC. He's knee-deep in the 3+2 Integrated Degree Program, chasing that elusive Master's degree.  And guess what? He's not just hitting the books; he's interning at Professor Vikram Adve's Computing Lab!

Now, hold onto your hats because there's this piece of code floating around on the lab server that's become the campus legend. Word on the digital street is, crack that code, and Professor Vikram transforms into the Oprah of grades – "You get an A, you get an A, everybody gets an A!"

But here's the kicker – bullNull's scratching his head over this code like it's a cosmic puzzle. It's a format he's never seen before, and he's one confused coding cowboy. Can you help him to decode this cryptic masterpiece? It's a digital SOS, my friend!
